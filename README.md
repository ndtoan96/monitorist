# monitorist
A Windows app to quickly control all your monitor brightness and nightlight.

## Introduction

Have you ever waken up at 3:00 AM, turned on your computer and the brightness blinded you. You try to tune it down but realize that you cannot change your external monitor brightness from your computer. If so, this app is for you.

Monitorist helps you control your monitors brightness, both internal and external one, as well as nightlight mode. You can also set some predefined profiles (example: one for day and one for night), then apply them with just one click.
